Steps to run my CallGraph tool to generate the Callgraph: 1. Download and extract the zip file to a location. 2. In Visual Studio Command Prompt, go to that folder. 3. Then compile using the command: mwc.pl -type vc11 -features pin=1,ia32=1,intel64=0 -include %PINPP_ROOT%\MPC\config 4. Then open the sln file using the command: devenv /useenv call_graph.sln 5. Rebuild the solution and the dll file will be generated in the PINPP_ROOT's lib folder. It will be named as my_callgraph.dll 6. Run the pin tool using the command: pin -t lib\my_callgraph.dll -- <APP.EXE> eg: pin -t lib\my_callgraph.dll -- notepad.exe 7. The pintool will generate the file my_callgraph.out and my_graph.gv files in the PINPP_ROOT folder. 8. The my_callgraph.out file is for reference only. It shows the stack push and pop operations and have been included for information only. 9. The my_graph.gv file can be rendered using the DOT command of Graphviz: dot -Tpng my_graph.gv -o my_graph.png 10. The my_graph.png will show the call graph. It shows the condensed graph.
